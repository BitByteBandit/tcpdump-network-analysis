# Analyzing Network Traffic with tcpdump

This project demonstrates how to capture and analyze network traffic using tcpdump in a virtual lab environment. The lab consists of two virtual machines (VMs):
- **Kali Linux**: The attacker machine, used to generate network traffic.
- **Ubuntu**: The target machine, where tcpdump is used to capture and analyze traffic.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Simulate a network attack and analyze the traffic using tcpdump.
- **Tools Used**: tcpdump, nmap, ping, Wireshark.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - How to capture network traffic using tcpdump.
  - How to analyze traffic to identify potential threats.
  - How to use tools like nmap and ping to generate traffic.
 
 ## The capture.pcap file can be ran in Wireshark to view.
